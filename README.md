# E-Commerce Online Shopping Predictions

The aim of the project was to estimate the probability of sessions on the E-Commerce online shopping site to end with or without a purchase.
In the project we built a system that predicts the chances of a certain user, under certain conditions to make a purchase while browsing the site.
The project deals with a binary classification problem, where each session can end with only 2 ways of classification.
We have got Several features, for some we knew the meaning and others were anonymous. To maximize the use of all feature, we tried to reach conclusions about the meaning and interpretation of each feature.

In the project we used a lot of the material taught in the course and based on it We made many assumptions that helped us in its realization.
As mentioned, for optimal prediction, we performed the same process on the test data and used the pre-processing of the training data in order to process them.
It is important for us to note the circularity of the process. We performed several iterations of each step, where in each iteration we relied on the results of the previous iterations, and made considerations such as which values should be removed or how to normalize the data to ultimately give the best predictions from our models.

Although we didn't delve into this in the project, in my opinion there is also great importance for a business understanding of an internet sales website as a result of the project we did to improve it's business performance.
